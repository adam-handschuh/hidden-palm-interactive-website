        In this new section, I'll be writing occasional pieces about topics I find interesting or updates about game developement and ideas on current projects.
         The formatting of this section is subject to change and I might mess around with the style of writing and see what works best. For now this is quite a new and experimental
         section that I'm just trying out.
